# Type Data Python
4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, there are **List**, **Tuple**, **Set**, and **Dictionary**, all with different qualities and usage.

## **List**
- To declare a list, brackets **[ ]** are used and each member is separated by a comma.
- List items are indexed, the index start form **0**
- List items are *ordered, changeable*, and *allow duplicate values*
- Lists can contain members of the same or different types

#### **Slicing**
The method to access items from a list calls the list's name followed by the item's index in question, namely with the format name **list [index]**. In addition, access to a number of items from the index to the index can also be done.

## **Tuple**
- A tuple is a collection which is *ordered, allow duplicate values* and *unchangeable*.
- Tuples are written with round brackets **( )**
- Tuple items can be of any data type

## **Set**
- A set is a collection which is *unordered*, *unchangeable*, and *unindexed*.
- Sets are written with curly brackets **{ }**
- Set items can be of any data type

## **Dictionary**
- Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name
- Dictionaries are written with curly brackets **{ }**, and have keys and values
